<p >I was assembled slowly and carefully, with craftsmanship and pride from the abundant native Totara, Matai and Rimu trees of New Zealand. I was built from the ground up, following traditional British building methods brought with the settlers establishing life in New Zealand. Timber into soil and planks supporting each other to frame my small Cottage body. Other houses around me were all built the same way and out of the same materials, but we are all unique, special to our inhabitants. I was covered in cladding to keep the outside from getting in and to keep my family safe, warm and healthy. I am a remnant of the original European cottages that provide only what you need, a safe comforting space that functions well, perfect for the basics of living.  These settlers are putting down their roots, making a small slice of the land their own and an individualised place to exist from.

<p >I burn coal and wood in a coal range to keep my family warm, heat their water and cook their food. This is my most important space, my heart, where the family gathers to be together, the space in which quality meaningful social interactions are facilitated and guests can experience commensality and comradery.  </p>
<img class="halfimage" src="coalrange.jpg">
</div>
<p id="pastthree">I grew with my family, I changed and evolved with them. I became more than just a utility and developed into an extension of their being. I was a reflection of their values and their way of life. Due to my small size, the way my family uses my space shows what is prioritised and therefore what is valued.  For example, they value time as a family and commensality therefore their table is large, filling the space, displaying its importance in the house and their lives. The newly developed community requires it’s people to live off of the land to maintain their sustainable way of life so hard work is expected but also respected. Displaying efforts of a successful lifestyle inside of me in these new conditions establishes my families value in the community. Everyone living here started with the same social status but as time goes on, the residence judge each others success based on how they present themselves and their house.</p>
<img class="fullimage" src="wallaceville.png">
<p id="pastfour">I meet all the needs of my family, but as they are expanding, I am shrinking, and created more problems than I solve, so they need to move on. It is not easy for them to leave me because I symbolise the beginning of their lives together in an unknown country. I am a familiar feeling and a comfort of home. I also allow a way for them to connect to the land and culture, making their transition into New Zealand posible. </p>
</div>
<div id="present" class="hide">
<h2>Present</h2>
<p>Houses like me became common and then outdated as more and more people heard word of the rich culture and lifestyle of living in New Zealand. The land is now inundated with houses. Farms became property spaces and properties became subdivisions. The appeal of New Zealand life was its own undoing as the land was overtaken with residents, the old way of life was lost and a new culture was born. </p>
<img class="fullimage" src="wallacevillenew.jpg">
<p>I now house a family with children to protect, so my job is more important to these parents than ever before. The kids spend all their time in their room, they crave their own space and environment to control away from the structure of the home. I saw their first steps, their first words and even their birth and now all they do is put pins in me and cover my walls in decorations, but this makes each room personal, unique and special, an expression of personality. I am familiar and comfortable to them, a constant reminder of childhood. </p>
<img src="">
<p>The values and culture attached to the old style of my structure has translated onto my family's simple, older fashioned way of practical living. My colour and contents is constantly updated to stay personal to the family but my original style is still intact and I am only ever modified to keep the family healthy, never to stay modern or popular. Other modern houses may be valued more in the market but I do my job with what I have. I have the essential spaces needed for a family, nothing in excess and my family values the cozy spaces that I do provide.  I change for my family, I move my walls to give them space to spend important time together when the kids were young and when everywhere inside me was a valued communal space. </p>

<img src="">
<p>My family creates my value, without them I would be only a structure. I mean different things to the various people that have lived in me but I am only valuable to them. To others, I am just a space, I am real estate. To them, my value lies in my utility and materials. People also use me to judge the social status on my family. My materials, style and presentation all contribute to the social value created by the community. </p>
<img class="halfimage" src="house2.png">
<p>My family takes care of me, because I take care of them. I am made to last, or at least to be easily adapted when necessary. When I break, they can fix me, when I get borer and mold, they replace my pieces because I can’t keep them healthy if I am sick too. Although I am taken care of, I am worn down from use over the years. My crumbling floors are replaced with concrete instead of the original timber as the native trees are now conserved and protected as a part of New Zealand's identity. </p>
<img class="fullimage" src="houseone.png">

<p>For quite some time now I have been using electricity as well as wood and coal. I can do all the same things but electricity is instant and the value of the process and effort in sourcing and preparing fuels is disregarded. This disconnects my family from the effects that using this energy has on the environment, as it has with all modern households. The outdated methods of creating heat has instilled simple, practical living values into the children including using and respecting the resources that nature provides.  Unfortunately this came paired with an ignorance of the long term effects the earth has recently learnt pollution causes. </p>

<h2>Future</h2>
<img class="fullimage" src="city2.jpg">
<p>As space on the earth has become minimal with the drastic increase of humans and housing required for them, people have built vertically. I don't see the sun anymore surrounded by towering synthetic apartment buildings. I am not a common or current feature of the earth, instead, a cause for nostalgia of how life used to be for those still around to remember.  I represent the feeling of home for everyone that has abandoned theirs for cookie cutter matchbox apartments. Every part of me links to a memory from the life my family spent together, but now that they are gone, I have lost all value as a whole. My walls were scuffed, my floor was scratched and my roof was leaking but I was a home. I still hold an impression of everyone who has lived in me but it is meaningless to the rest of the world.  </p>
<img class="halfimage" src="buildingfour.jpg">
<img class="halfimage" src="buildingthree.jpg">

<p>My preservation as a house was abandoned when wood became scarce. Trees can no longer grow in the earth's current condition. Any that were standing have either died or been cleared during the mass deforestation to accommodate for the explosion of apartment buildings.</p>
<img class="fullimage" src="deforestation4.jpg">
<img class="fullimage" src="deforestation7.jpg">
<p>Native timber is especially rare as it is the only thing left that can connect the people with the New Zealand land and dying culture. When humans realised that culture was worth saving, native trees value skyrocketed but it was too late to save them. </p>
<img class="halfimage" src="quarrythree.jpg">
<img class="halfimage" src="quarrytwo.jpg">
<p>My style was classic but it is seen as an outdated visual inconvenience for the industrial, impersonal clones erected around me. I have been ripped apart, my value is only determined by my materials, what can be used, what can be sold and what is useless. Whatever remains has been left for dead, my natural decay can’t nourish the ecosystem because humans destroyed that long ago.  I will just turn to dust, worthless to the planet. The supposed advancement and evolution of mankind has resulted in the devolution of the planet and humans relationship to it. Humans were once one with the earth, they were connected to the land that they called home but they have destroyed it to the point where there is no nature, no biodiversity. They are all that is left.</p>
<img src="">
<p>My coal range is useless and despised, now it represents the time when humans killed their own environment. Burning fossil fuels for heat is an archaic practise that humans now realise contributed to them single handedly collapsing an ecosystem. There’s nothing left to burn now and there’s nothing left worth saving.</p><br>
